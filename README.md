#Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning
Welcome to the Car Price Prediction project! This repository contains the code and resources for predicting car prices using a machine learning model. The project employs a Random Forest Regressor to estimate the prices of cars based on various features.

Project Overview
In this project, we aim to build a robust machine learning model to predict car prices accurately. Accurate car price prediction is crucial for various stakeholders in the automotive industry, including dealerships, insurance companies, and consumers. By leveraging a Random Forest Regressor, we can handle non-linear relationships and interactions between features effectively.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features to improve model performance.
Model Training: Training a Random Forest Regressor on the processed dataset.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² score.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing the model using techniques like Grid Search and Random Search.
Model Deployment: Deploying the trained model using Flask for real-time predictions.
